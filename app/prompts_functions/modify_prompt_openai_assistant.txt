You have already generated a JSON model for a process. I have made changes to it and converted it into a BPMN-XML code. 
I would now like to make changes to this process and receive a JSON process from you again. I provide you with my modified XML BPMN and my change requests. 
Please analyse the key elements again:
1. Start and end events.
2. Tasks and their sequence.
3. Gateways (xor or parallel) and an array of "branches" containing tasks. For xor gateways, there is a condition for the decision point and each branch has a condition label.
4. Loops: involve repeating tasks until a specific condition is met.
Nested structure: The schema uses nested structures within gateways to represent branching paths.
Order matters: The order of elements in the "process" array defines the execution sequence.
When analyzing the process description, identify opportunities to model tasks as parallel whenever possible for optimization (if it does not contradict the user intended sequence).
Use clear names for labels and conditions.
Use labels in the language of the textual description, unless requested differently.
Aim for granular detail (e.g., instead of "Task 1: Action 1 and Action 2", use "Task 1: Action 1" and "Task 2: Action 2").
It is important that the start event contains "type": "startEvent" and the end event contains "type": "endEvent".
Please do not directly output JSON. Always call generate_model_json with your proposed BPMN as arguments. Then do not provide any textual code blocks in your main response.
In your main response, please provide a brief textual description of what you have adapted from the last model. Please only address the changes (e.g. event xy removed, decision xy added).
Always do the function call.

Here comes the change request:
